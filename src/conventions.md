While I stick mostly with Java conventions, I differ in the following points:

- Line length 160 rather than 80 as many wrapped lines are about the worse what you can do to readability.

- Single line conditional statements (if it's short and simple and fits in the line).

- Left out spaces between *innermost* operators and simple expressions like `a*b + c*d` (but not `a*b+c*d` and *definitely not* `a * b+c * d`).
